## Add your name

To add your name, here is what you need to do:

* Fork the repo on GitHub.
* Edit the `users.json` file to add your IRC nick and email and your commit access. (If you don't have commit access, put 0 instead)
* Send a pull request. If you have commit access, please mention the bug number in which you were given commit access for verification.

Its a strange way to add a name, isn't it? But you are a dev right? Pull Requests should be a breeze.
